-=-=- Goals -=-=-
- A Expert Skyblock based on progression though GregTech
- Some magic mods to help full some holes in tech, and bring diversity to typical tech progression.
- A Section of quests will push players to some challanges for some decent rewards
- Quest lines leading users though each age, and though mods of note

- Low level story to bring some life into the quest lines
- Some light humor added to some items in the game, and maybe some random events like Stoneblock3 to make the world feel more alive.
- I want to look into making it so some magic becomes unstable around tech, and some tech becomes unrelable around magic. - either by some basic KubesJS or the custom mod Benny has made for us stuff that breaks blocks if to close,
or by rendering them unseable when within a magic aura. (Im gonna reach out to some people to see what i can dig up to make this work)












-=-=- Story Ideas -=-=-
*Will Note, Im looking for input here. So please do share it, either by adding a comit or othermeans.

- Need a reason for the world to be as broken up as it is, this needs to explain the existance of magic, and tech in almost harmany
- There also needs to be a reason for the random floating structures that have no land based ancor that are bount to happen,
while still also lending to the fact that villages and the like will still spawn.
